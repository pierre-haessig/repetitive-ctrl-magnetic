# Repetitive control for magnetic flux control

This repository contains the code and a report on my exploration of
[repetitive control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_control)
and its application to control a test bench for loss measurement of magnetic materials
([Epstein frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein_frame)).

This work is a follow-up on a June 2019 discussion with Anh-Tuan Vo and Afef Lebouc
from [G2Elab](http://www.g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr/en)
who are actually working and controlling this system.
Code available here contains only [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org/) models,
in particular using the
[Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes](https://build.openmodelica.org/Documentation/Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.html) library.
